Test
Provide an HTML page containing 2 fields where user can enter 2 urls and a validation button triggering a function.The triggered Javascript function will use those 2 urls and parse the DOM to get the specifications of both product. Then specifications will be displayed on the same HTML page in a three columns table with labels of specifications in the first column then the specifications in the 2 other columns.

Specifications:


Consider two random phone product urls from lazada, for example:

http://www.lazada.vn/nokia-105-man-hinh-mau-14-xanh-76651.html
http://www.lazada.vn/apple-iphone-5c-retina-4-8mp-32gb-vang-106908.html
Use the method of your choice that would be the most effective to perform the job.
Any Javascript library can be used to help.
